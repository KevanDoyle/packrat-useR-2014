        <p>This tutorial will walk you through some of the most common tasks you’ll want
to do with packrat, and explain the fundamental concepts behind the package on
the way.</p>

<h2 id="first-things-first">First things first</h2>

<p>You’re getting ready to start a new project, so you create a new directory that
will eventually contain all the .R scripts, CSV data, and other files that are
needed for this particular project.</p>

<p>You know you’re going to need to make use of several R packages over the course
of this project. So before you write your first line of code, set up the
project directory to use Packrat with <code>packrat::init</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; packrat::init("~/projects/babynames")
Adding these packages to packrat:
            _         
    packrat   0.2.0.128

Fetching sources for packrat (0.2.0.128) ... OK (GitHub)
Snapshot written to '/Users/kevin/projects/babynames/packrat/packrat.lock'
Installing packrat (0.2.0.128) ... OK (built source)
init complete!
Packrat mode on. Using library in directory:
- "~/projects/babynames/packrat/lib" 
</code></pre>

<p>(Tip: If the current working directory is the project directory, you can omit
the path.)</p>

<p>After initializing the project, you will be placed into packrat mode in the
project directory. You’re ready to go!</p>

<p>You’re no longer in an ordinary R project; you’re in a Packrat project. The
main difference is that <strong>a packrat project has its own private package
library</strong>. Any packages you install from inside a packrat project are only
available to that project; and packages you install outside of the project are
not available to the project.</p>

<p>This is what we mean by “isolation” and it’s Very Good Thing, as it means that
upgrading a package for one project won’t break a totally different project
that just happens to reside on the same machine, even if that package contained
incompatible changes.</p>

<p>A packrat project contains a few extra files and directories. The <code>init()</code>
function creates these files for you, if they don’t already exist.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>packrat/packrat.lock</code>:</strong> Lists the precise package versions that were used
to satisfy dependencies, including dependencies of dependencies. (This file
should never be edited by hand!)</li>
  <li><strong><code>packrat/packrat.opts</code>:</strong> Project-specific packrat options. These can be
queried and set with <code>get_opts</code> and <code>set_opts</code>; see <code>?"packrat-options"</code> for
more information.</li>
  <li><strong><code>packrat/lib/</code>:</strong> Private package library for this project.</li>
  <li><strong><code>packrat/src/</code>:</strong> Source packages of all the dependencies that packrat has
been made aware of.</li>
  <li><strong><code>.Rprofile</code>:</strong> Directs R to use the private package library (when it is
started from the project directory).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adding-removing-and-updating-packages">Adding, removing, and updating packages</h2>

<p>Adding a package in a Packrat project is easy. The first step is to start R
inside your Packrat project, and install the package however you normally do;
usually that means either the <code>install.packages()</code> function or the “Install
Packages” button in your favorite R IDE. Let’s do this now, with the <code>reshape2</code>
package.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages("reshape2")
</code></pre>

<p>If you completed the previous steps correctly, you just installed the
<code>reshape2</code> package from CRAN into your project’s private package library. Let’s
take a snapshot to save the changes in Packrat:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; packrat::snapshot()

Adding these packages to packrat:
             _       
    plyr       1.8.1 
    Rcpp       0.11.2
    reshape2   1.4   
    stringr    0.6.2 

Fetching sources for plyr (1.8.1) ... OK (CRAN current)
Fetching sources for Rcpp (0.11.2) ... OK (CRAN current)
Fetching sources for reshape2 (1.4) ... OK (CRAN current)
Fetching sources for stringr (0.6.2) ... OK (CRAN current)
Snapshot written to '/Users/kevin/projects/babynames/packrat/packrat.lock'
</code></pre>

<p>If you have automatic snapshots turned on, Packrat will record package upgrades
and additions in the background, so you don’t even need to remember to call
<code>::snapshot()</code> manually unless you’re performing a less common action.</p>

<p>When packrat takes a snapshot, it looks in the project’s private package
library for packages that have been added, modified, or removed since the last
time <code>snapshot</code> was called. For packages that were added or modified, packrat
attempts to go find the uncompiled <em>source package</em> from CRAN, BioConductor, or
GitHub (caveat: only for packages that were installed using <code>devtools</code> version
1.4 or later), and save them in the <code>packrat/src</code> project subdirectory. It
also records metadata about each package in the <code>packrat.lock</code> file.</p>

<p>Because we save source packages for all of your dependencies, packrat makes
your project more <strong>reproducible</strong>. When someone else wants to run your
project–even if that someone else is you, years in the future, dusting off
some old backups–they won’t need to try to figure out what versions of what
packages you were running, and where you got them.</p>

<h2 id="restoring-snapshots">Restoring snapshots</h2>

<p>Once your project has a snapshot, you can easily install the packages from that
snapshot into your private library at any time.</p>

<p>You’ll need to do this, for example, when copying the project to a new
computer, especially to one with a different operating system. Let’s simulate
this by exiting R and then deleting the <code>library</code> subdirectory in your project.
Then launch R from your project directory again.</p>

<p>Packrat automates the whole process for you – upon restarting R in this
directory, you should see the following output:</p>

<pre><code>Packrat is not installed in the local library -- attempting to bootstrap an installation...
&gt; Installing packrat into project private library:
- '/Users/kevin/projects/babynames/packrat/lib/x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0/3.2.0'

** preparing package for lazy loading

** testing if installed package can be loaded
* DONE (packrat)
&gt; Attaching packrat
&gt; Restoring library

Installing Rcpp (0.11.2) ... OK (built source)
Installing reshape2 (1.4) ... OK (built source)
Installing stringr (0.6.2) ... OK (built source)
&gt; Packrat bootstrap successfully completed. Entering packrat mode...
Packrat mode on. Using library in directory:
- "~/projects/babynames/packrat/lib"
</code></pre>

<p>All of the packages in the snapshot have now been installed in your project’s
newly created private package library.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; packrat::status()
Up to date.
</code></pre>

<p>Another reason to restore from the packrat snapshot is if you remove a package
that you later realize you still needed, or if one of your collaborators makes
their own changes to the snapshot. In these cases, you can call
<code>packrat::restore()</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s remove the plyr package, and use <code>packrat::restore()</code> to bring it back.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; remove.packages("plyr")
Removing package from ‘/Users/kevin/projects/babynames/packrat/lib/x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0/3.2.0’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)

&gt; packrat::status()

The following packages are used in your code, tracked by packrat, but no longer present in your library:
            from   to
    plyr   1.8.1   NA

Use packrat::restore() to restore these libraries.

&gt; packrat::restore()
Installing plyr (1.8.1) ... OK (built source)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning up</h2>

<p>Package libraries can grow over time to include many packages that were needed
at one time but are no longer used. Packrat can analyze your code and try to
determine which packages you’re using so you can keep your library tidy. Let’s
take a look at <code>::status()</code> again:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; packrat::status()
The following packages are installed but not needed:
             _       
    plyr       1.8.1 
    Rcpp       0.11.2
    reshape2   1.4   
    stringr    0.6.2 

Use packrat::clean() to remove them. Or, if they are actually needed
by your project, add `library(packagename)` calls to a .R file
somewhere in your project.
</code></pre>

<p>Notice these packages are “installed but not needed”. Packrat attempts to
ascertain which packages your project needs by analyzing the *.R script files
in your project and looking for calls like <code>library()</code> and <code>require()</code>. </p>

<p>Our sample project doesn’t have any R code yet, so Packrat isn’t aware that we
need any packages. Let’s add some code that depends on the packages. Create a
.R file in your project directory with the following contents and save it:</p>

<pre><code>library(reshape2)
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s take another look at <code>::status()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; packrat::status()
Up to date.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if we were actually finished with the packages, we’d have used
<code>packrat::clean()</code> to remove them.</p>
