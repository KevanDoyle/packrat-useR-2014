        <h2 id="packrat-is-a-dependency-management-system-for-r">Packrat is a dependency management system for R.</h2>

<p>R package dependencies can be frustrating. Have you ever had to use
trial-and-error to figure out what R packages you need to install to make
someone else’s code work–and then been left with those packages globally
installed forever, because now you’re not sure whether you need them? Have you
ever updated a package to get code in one of your projects to work, only to
find that the updated package makes code in another project <em>stop</em> working? </p>

<p>We built packrat to solve these problems. Use packrat to make your R projects
more:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Isolated:</strong> Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break
your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because packrat gives each
project its own private package library.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Easily transport your projects from one computer to another,
even across different platforms. Packrat makes it easy to install the
packages your project depends on.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducible:</strong> Packrat records the exact package versions you depend on,
and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you
go.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts</h2>

<p>If you’re like the vast majority of R users, when you start working on a new R
project you create a new directory for all of your R scripts and data files.</p>

<p>Packrat enhances your project directory by storing your package dependencies
inside it, rather than relying on your personal R library that is shared across
all of your other R sessions. We call this directory your <strong>private package
library</strong> (or just <strong>private library</strong>). When you start an R session in a
packrat project directory, R will only look for packages in your private
library; and anytime you install or remove a package, those changes will be
made to your private library.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, private libraries don’t travel well; like all R libraries, their
contents are compiled for your specific machine architecture, operating system,
and R version. Packrat lets you <strong>snapshot</strong> the state of your private library,
which saves to your project directory whatever information packrat needs to be
able to recreate that same private library on another machine. The process of
installing packages to a private library from a snapshot is called
<strong>restoring</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="installing-packrat">Installing packrat</h2>

<p>Until packrat is ready for CRAN, you can install it directly from GitHub using
<a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools">devtools</a>. <strong>It’s very important that you
use devtools 1.4 or later to install packrat, otherwise you will get errors
when you try to use it.</strong> If you already have devtools installed, make sure
it’s 1.4 or later before proceeding.</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages("devtools")
&gt; devtools::install_github("rstudio/packrat")
</code></pre>

<p>You’ll also need to make sure your machine is able to build packages from
source. See <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites">Package Development
Prerequisites</a> for the
tools needed for your operating system.</p>
